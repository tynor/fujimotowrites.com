&lt;p&gt;We capped off 2024 with a multi-stop trip, starting in Raleigh, NC,
where we spent Christmas with Mallory&amp;rsquo;s family.
They were wonderful hosts, and we thoroughly enjoyed all the
festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stop took us to Los Angeles.
We visited Griffith Observatory, the Long Beach Aquarium, and spent a
day at Disneyland, which was stunningly decked out for the season.
One of our favorite new discoveries was Porto&amp;rsquo;s—a cuban bakery and
cafe with an incredible selection of pastries, sandwiches, and desserts.
The cubano sandwich was an instant favorite.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Holidays 2024</title><link>https://fujimotowrites.com/posts/holidays-2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 01:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://fujimotowrites.com/posts/holidays-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays!
We hope everyone had a wonderful 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest event for us this year (by far) was getting married in
August, at McMenamins Anderson School not far from where we live in
Bothell, WA.
The ceremony and reception were everything we could have dreamed of and
more.
Seeing both our families together was a treat we will cherish forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after the excitement of the wedding, we took our honeymoon at
Poipu on Kauai island, Hawaii.
It was blissful to relax in pools and have divine dining experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
