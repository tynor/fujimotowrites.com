The biggest event for us this year (by far) was getting married in August, at McMenamins Anderson School not far from where we live in Bothell, WA. The ceremony and reception were everything we could have dreamed of and more. Seeing both our families together was a treat we will cherish forever.
A few days after the excitement of the wedding, we took our honeymoon at Poipu on Kauai island, Hawaii.

We hope everyone had a wonderful 2024.</p><p>The biggest event for us this year (by far) was getting married in
August, at McMenamins Anderson School not far from where we live in
Bothell, WA.
The ceremony and reception were everything we could have dreamed of and
more.

Poipu on Kauai island, Hawaii.

Our passion for ballroom dance grew over the course of the year,
crescendoing in October when we participated in our first competition:
Summit DanceSport about 20 miles south of us.
We even won several first places, albeit when competing uncontested.
It was an honor to compete alongside our teacher and another couple from
our studio.</p><p>Tynor moved on from Amazon after almost two and a half years.
He now works at Peach Finance, a finance tech company that works with
lenders to provide loan services.</p><p>Mallory is still working at Pfizer as a senior associate scientist.
She enjoys crafting, playing guitar, and seeing live shows including a
benefit concert by Patty Griffin at Benaroya Hall in Seattle.</p><p>In March, we took a trip up to Vancouver, BC and saw Dancing with the
Stars live, featuring pro dancers from the show.
Our visiting around Vancouver was impeded by cold weather and rain, but
we still found some good food, enjoyed the show, and the weather cleared
up enough for us to walk around Stanley Park before we headed home.</p><p>We are looking forward to more adventures in 2025, and wish everyone a
relaxing holidays and happy new year!</p></article><section class=post-nav><ul><li></li><li></li></ul></section></main><footer><ul><li><h6>Rendered by <a href=https://gohugo.io title=Hugo>Hugo</a> |
